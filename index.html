<p>Sit down,relax,grab a bag of popcorn, some drinks and gather your friends
  as I dazzle you with my very impressive life as a short story in this webpage.
  I'll take you through time and space, inspired by deadlines to meet and the
  urge to have a portfolio page for future purposes through a journey with a
  better story line than that of the black panther movie and Bruce Almighty
  combined.<br> Let's begin <br> Copyright(c)Wesley2018.

<!--Just an addition to make the webpage longer-->
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Well well well...<br> You have come to the end of this incredible webpage, sadly
  there is no more content to display here since in every good story there has to
  be an ending. You are free to review the page as many times as possible and
  kindly tell your friend to tell a friend to tell another friend and tell my ex
  and futures to view this awesome page. Send feedback through the various contacts
  I've displayed or just say hi to show you've gone through the content. I know,
  I know, that you don't want to leave but now you have to exit and go back to your
  normal lives and resume normal programming. You can chase away the friends you had
  gathered now. Sorry that I've taken this long to finish my story but I still need to
  add enough content so that it looks long enough. If you've stayed here up until
  this message I honestly salute you because I just zoned out and I'm just writing
  lorem ipsum here but in my own words. Here's a present for taking your time to read all
  of this.<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/wesley_mutwiri">Present</a> or this
  other present <a href="http://watchseries-online.pw/">Alternative present</a>.<br>
  It's really your choice. I think the webpage is long enough and I can finally say
  goodbye. Goodbye.There I've said it.</p>
<!--Final words in closing the webpage-->
  <h4> <strong>PS.. </strong><em>Don't forget to tell me about anything I need to change, feedback is
    required even if it's non-constructive, sort of rude, obnoxious, annoying,
    unthoughtful e.t.c.I think you get my point. I'm a big boy and I can take it.<em><h4>
